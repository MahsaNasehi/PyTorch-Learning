## Course Structure & Key Learnings

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Section 1 - Linear Regression & Model Basics

**Description:**  
This section covers the fundamentals of building a simple linear regression model with PyTorch, including how to define, train, and save models.

**What I learned:**
- Building a **Linear Regression** model from scratch using `nn.Linear`
- Using **`L1Loss`** for regression tasks
- Saving and loading model weights using `model.state_dict()` and `torch.save()`

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Section 2 - Binary & Multi-Label Classification

**Description:**  
This section introduces the concepts of binary and multi-label classification using PyTorch. It also explores loss functions, evaluation metrics, and decision boundary visualization.

**What I learned:**
- Implementing **binary classification** models
- Building **multi-label classification** systems
- Using the **`BCEWithLogitsLoss`** (Binary Cross Entropy with logits)
- Understanding the full **training** and **inference** pipeline:
  - Forward pass
  - Loss computation
  - Backward pass
  - Parameter update
  - Evaluation
- Visualizing model decisions with `plot_decision_boundary`
- Using `torchmetrics.Accuracy` for model evaluation

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Section 3 - MNIST & FashionMNIST Classification

**Description:**  
This section focuses on image classification using the MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets. Various neural network architectures are explored, ranging from simple linear layers to more complex convolutional layers.

**What I learned:**
- How to perform classification on **MNIST** and **FashionMNIST** using:
  - Linear layers
  - Non-linear layers (with activation functions)
  - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- How to use **`torchvision.datasets`** to load built-in datasets
- Working with **`DataLoader`** for batching and shuffling
- Implementing **loss functions** like `CrossEntropyLoss`
- Using **optimizers** such as `Adam` and `SGD`
- Tracking performance with:
  - **`torchmetrics`** (for accuracy and other metrics)
  - **confusion matrix** (via `mlxtend.plotting.plot_confusion_matrix`)
- Saving and loading trained models using `torch.save()` and `torch.load()`

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Section 4 - Custom Image Classification with PyTorch

**Description:**  
This section focuses on training image classification models on custom datasets using PyTorch. It includes working with standardized folder structures, creating custom dataset classes, and writing flexible, device-agnostic code.

**What I learned:**
- How to structure image datasets in the standard format compatible with `ImageFolder`
- Using `torchvision.datasets.ImageFolder` to automatically load images and assign class labels
- Creating a **custom dataset class** (`ImageFolderCustom`) for more control and customization
- Loading and transforming images with `torchvision.transforms`
- Exploring folder contents with a helper function: `walk_through_dir()`
- Writing **device-agnostic code** using `torch.device` for compatibility with both CPU and GPU
- Visualizing model architecture and parameter details using `torchinfo.summary()`
- Training an image classification model on the **pizza_steak_sushi** dataset
